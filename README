Navi-Tour is a dynamic local destination discovery app.  Tours can be pre-loaded to help the user discover great local destinations to eat, sleep and play.  The user can then create and share their own tour, adding unique destinations with recommendations and photos for each destination.  The goal of the app is to provide a dynamic local destination discovery tool for users to get out and explore the area around them. 

This app is used to host and explore local tours via your iOS app, the Denso NaviBridge App and your Denso GPS unit.  

This app was developed using Titanium Alloy, Appcelerator Cloud Services, NaviBridge Module, and the Google Places API.

To Use:

-Download Code
-Download the Denso NaviBride Module from the Appcelerator Marketplace
-Build the app on Titanium Alloy using 2.1.3GA SDK

Future enhancements could include:
-geo based audio and video during the drive explaining about the area and the upcoming destination
-extended details on the destinations to include links to useful websites, a scrollable view of pictures, more contact details and user comments and reviews
-In-App purchasing of additional sponsored tours
-In park tours to provide the "Perfect day at the Park" i.e. start here, go on this ride, eat here, then go to this show, etc
